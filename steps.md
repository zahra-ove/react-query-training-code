1. a new react project created by vite:
    - npm create vite@lates
    - npm install
    - npm run dev
   

2. install `react-query` library:
    - npm i '@tanstack/react-query'

3. one of my main question was, what is the difference
between react-custom-hook and react-module?

the answer of chatGPT 3.5 is:

React Modules: React modules typically refer to reusable components, such as functional or class-based components, that encapsulate a specific piece of UI functionality. React modules encapsulate both state and UI logic within themselves.
React Custom Hooks: React custom hooks are functions that allow you to extract and reuse stateful logic from components. Custom hooks do not contain any UI themselves; they are purely for encapsulating logic.
